# Contact MVC Web App Walkthrough

We have successfully built the Vanilla JavaScript Contact MVC Web App with full CRUD functionality, leveraging a modern, premium design system.

## Changes Made
- **Structured UI**: Created [index.html](file:///c:/Users/GOZA/OneDrive/Codes/Antigavity/JS-MVC/index.html) with a clean layout, search bar functionality, and a dedicated modal for adding and editing contacts.
- **Modern Styling**: Developed [css/style.css](file:///c:/Users/GOZA/OneDrive/Codes/Antigavity/JS-MVC/css/style.css) featuring a dark mode glassmorphism UI, CSS custom properties, Google Fonts (Inter), Boxicons, and micro-animations for an interactive feel.
- **MVC Architecture**: Implemented the application logic in Vanilla JavaScript across dedicated files, fully commented for clarity:
  - [Model.js](file:///c:/Users/GOZA/OneDrive/Codes/Antigavity/JS-MVC/js/Model.js): Manages the application state (contacts array) and seamlessly handles `localStorage` synchronization for data persistence.
  - [View.js](file:///c:/Users/GOZA/OneDrive/Codes/Antigavity/JS-MVC/js/View.js): Takes charge of all DOM manipulation, event capturing, dynamic rendering of the contact list, and visual states.
  - [Controller.js](file:///c:/Users/GOZA/OneDrive/Codes/Antigavity/JS-MVC/js/Controller.js): Acts as the intermediary, translating user inputs from the View into data modifications in the Model, and pushing data updates back to the UI.
  - [app.js](file:///c:/Users/GOZA/OneDrive/Codes/Antigavity/JS-MVC/js/app.js): Bootstraps the application on document load.

## Validation Results
We used an automated browser agent to verify the application's functionality. The agent successfully:
1. Opened the application locally.
2. Interacted with the "Add Contact" button to gracefully open the modal.
3. Filled out the complete contact form with a new user's name, email, and phone number.
4. Submitted the form, confirming the modal closes and the newly created contact item animates into the list with automatically generated avatar initials.

### Browser Testing Recording
Below is a brief recording of the testing agent interacting with the newly built MVC web application.
