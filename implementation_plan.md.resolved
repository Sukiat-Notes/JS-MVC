# Vanilla JS Contact MVC Web App
A full Contact Management application using Vanilla JavaScript, following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern. It will feature full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities and use `localStorage` for data persistence. The design will be premium, modern, and feature micro-animations.

## User Review Required
None for now. The app will be built locally using Vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS.

## Proposed Changes

### Project Foundation
- #### [NEW] `index.html`
  The main HTML entry point featuring a clean, responsive layout. It will include a form for adding/editing contacts and a list container for displaying them.
- #### [NEW] `css/style.css`
  A vanilla CSS file implementing a modern, premium design system. It will feature:
  - Custom Google Fonts (Inter or Outfit)
  - CSS Variables for color theming (sleek dark mode or vibrant light mode)
  - Glassmorphism effects
  - Smooth transitions and hover animations
  - Responsive layout using Flexbox/Grid

### JavaScript MVC Architecture
- #### [NEW] `js/Model.js`
  Handles the application's data layer.
  - Manages state (array of contacts)
  - Handles `localStorage` synchronization
  - Provides methods: `addContact`, `editContact`, `deleteContact`, `getContacts`
- #### [NEW] `js/View.js`
  Handles the presentation layer and DOM manipulation.
  - Caches DOM elements
  - Binds events (submit, click on edit/delete)
  - Renders the contact list visually
  - Manages micro-animations via adding/removing CSS classes
- #### [NEW] `js/Controller.js`
  Acts as the middleman between Model and View.
  - Responds to View events
  - Updates Model
  - Triggers View updates
- #### [NEW] `js/app.js`
  The main initialization script that instantiates the Model, View, and Controller.

## Verification Plan
### Manual Verification
1. Run application locally (via Live Server or just opening HTML file)
2. Verify adding a new contact works and appears in the list.
3. Verify refreshing the page retains the contacts (localStorage works).
4. Verify editing a contact updates it immediately.
5. Verify deleting a contact removes it from the list.
6. Verify aesthetics and responsiveness across different window sizes.
